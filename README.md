# Krafna Collective

A website for the architecture practice [Krafna Collective](http://krafna.pt).

## Goals

- Update the existent website;
- Enable Https connection;
- More easily to maintain; 
- Facilitate adding new projects to the portfolio.

## Development

- ### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Use `ng serve -o` to automatically open the app on your browser

- ### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
Run `ng test --code-coverage` to have a look on your code coverage.

- ### Scripts
  
When updating the project's resources in the folder [images](src/assets/images) run the [fileSysScan.sh](src/fileSysScan.sh) to update the [projects JSON file](src/assets/projects.json) that describes its content.

## Production

- ### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
